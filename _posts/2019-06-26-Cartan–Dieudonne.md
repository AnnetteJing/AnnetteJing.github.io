This blog will be about one of the most covoluted proofs I have encountered during my undergraduate career: the proof for the [Cartan–Dieudonné Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan–Dieudonné_theorem) under quadratic spaces. I will be following [Prof. Peter Clark's](http://math.uga.edu/~pete/) proof in his [notes](http://math.uga.edu/~pete/quadraticforms.pdf), but add more details that aren't so obvious to first time readers. 

### Statement of the Theorem
Let $$V$$ be a nondegenerate quadratic space of dimension $$n$$. Then, every $$\sigma \in \mathcal{O}(V)$$ that is not the identity can be expressed as a product of $$n$$ reflections.
