Hello, I'm Annette Jing, or 靖婕勛 (pronounced Jing Jie-Shiun) in Mandarin Chinese. 
I just recently received my bachelors degree in Finance with double minors in Mathematics and Computer Science from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) and will be starting a [PhD in Statistics at Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu) this coming fall. 

I am also an alumnus of [LSE's General Course program](http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/The-General-Course) and it was an [econometrics course](http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/EC/2018_EC221.htm) I took there that helped me discover my interest for statistics. 

My current research interests lie at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics and causal inference, and I'm trying to learn as much about both sub-fields as possible. 

In my spare time, I like going to rock and metal concerts, draw, travel, and watch TV shows and animes. For more details, you can check out my [Interests page](./Interests.html).
